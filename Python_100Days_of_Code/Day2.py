 # Python as a calculator
    #Typing python on the terminal will open the window that shows its version and all, later you can do calculations there:
# This basically opens REPL--> Read Evaluate Print Loop
    # It does continuous calculations on terminal using REPL

                                            # Variables and Datatypes
# A variable is a name give to a memory location in a program.
# For Example: 
a = 30 #Variable == Container to store a value
b = 'happy' #Keywords == reserved words in python
c = 71.22 #identifiers == class/function/variable name
                                            
                                            #Data Types
"""
1. Integers
2. floating point numbers
3. Strings
4. None (a particular variable contains nothing)
Python automatically identifies the datatype for us"""

# Rules:
"""
1. A variable name can contain alphabets, digits and underscore
2. A variable name can only start with a alphabet or underscore
3. A variable name can't start with a digit
4. No white space is allowed to used inside a variable name
e.g. ajay, one8, seven, _seven, etc """
